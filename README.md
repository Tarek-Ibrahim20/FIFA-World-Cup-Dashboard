## FIFA World Cup Dashboard

For this project, I pulled data from the FIFA website. Integrate data into PowerQuery, cleanse it, and extract just the data required for analysis in accordance with the requirements.

Next, I go thoroughly into the fascinating FIFA World Cup dataset and uncover fascinating World Cup Tournament Information.

at last put these facts into powerful and instructive visuals by using Power BI
